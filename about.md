title: About
---

A Zig and systems programming group. 
Think graphics, game engines, browser runtimes, OS-dev,
compilers, databases, emulators, and anything else in that ballpark.

Though our meetups and discussions mostly surround Zig,
we unequivocally welcome discourse about other tools â€” Rust, C, C++, Assembly, whatever.
